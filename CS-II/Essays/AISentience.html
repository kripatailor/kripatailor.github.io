    <h1> Is AI Beneficial?</h1>
    <p> The generation has come to the point of everything being digital. Therefore we have to start thinking about the risks and the possibilities of the changes that are going to happen starting on from this time and forward. Starting with Artificial Intelligence Sentience, is it really beneficial? Many people think that for AI to be truly sentient, it would need to be able to feel, think, and be self-aware. However, an article written recently mentioned that robots cannot think or have feeling, or that they dont have emotions like us humans do. </p>
    <p> For example, if something ever happens to any our close friends or family, we always feel empathy or sympathetic for then, but would a robot be able to feel the same way towards us human as we feel towards other humans? Even though robots cannot be as sympathetic towards humans as us, they do however have some sort of feelings butit into their program, therefore they will feel some sort of emotion towards other people, just not as much as us humans. There are many AI systems out there that are in the process of being built, in which sentience have been demonstrated. If so, this can help us declare whether they should be afforded human rights. Although, AI's are capable of many different jobs without any additional training. However the problem is that we humans try to push robots to have feelings that don't have or cannot have. As intelligent as these robots are, they cannot feel emotions. </p>
    <p> Although a majority of the stuff that we do is now digital, therefore in that case it is beneficial. Such as Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, etc, we use these sort virtual assistance on a daily. There are even cars out there that have AI built into it such as Tesla, Lucid, and many more. Hence us humans use AI on a daily base and we take it for granted by not acknowledging how much we use technology everyday. </p>
    <p> Therefore yes AI is very beneficial, however I do think we take it for granted by using it on a daily, which is why AI Sentient robots would make us even lazier and it would cause more unemployment. </p>
