    <h1> Fingerprints:</h1>
    <p> HTTPS is a secure connection for websites that haves the purpose of ensuring the users privecy and security. Also provides a secure connection and finds a safe way to do data transfer. An HTTPS Proxy Appliance is the request or response protocol betweent the clients and servers that are used for secure trancastions and communications. MITM is a sort of cyber attack in which the attacker secretly relays the messages between two clients in which they believe they are directly communicating with each other. It presents the rick of personal imformation being lost in the process of "directly communicating with the other client". A hash is in short passing data through a formula which produces a result. A good hash is when the hash value if completely determind by the data being hashed or when hash function uses all the input data there. A CA, certificate authority is a very trusted entity that provides SSL. The SSL can be prevented by using HTTPS only or enable secure cookies. A SSL interception can be detected by reviewing the SSL -encrypted internet communication between the client and server. A false-positive is a problem that does not actually exist in the code so it does not need to be fixed. A false-negative is when the issues are not pick even when there are bugs in the appliciation being test or ran through. No, my school/ governement, ISP should not have that right because there could be personal information or stuff of sort that could said throughout the conversation which could have a risk of getting leaked. <p>
